For my project, I created an e-commerce app called A Click Away. My goal going into this project was to be able to create an application where products could be posted, reviewed, and "sold". Starting out, there was so many features I wanted to add, but shortly realized how much I didnt't know. This whole project was a massive learning oppurinity for me. I not only learned so much about rails and its exponential applications, but also about myself and my ability to learn quickly. Throughout this project, it was amazing how many skills I picked up through the process of trial and error. After finishing my project, I am very happy with how it came out. I struggled in the beginning with my routes and forms, but after applying myself I learned so much. Now, I am very confident with routes and forms. For me, projects like this force me to face places where I struggled in the past, but now can proudly say I have overcame those struggles. With so many resources online, there is so many ways to make yourself better if you apply yourself.

As for functionalities within my project, A Click Away, users can sign-up, login, or login through facebook. After this process, users will be redirected to the root path. There users can create a manufacturer, create products, and rate products. Each review is rated out of 5 and a comment. The review is found under the products description which include name, price, stock, the manufacturer_id, and a description. When a user creates a product, they can choose the manufacturer or create a manufacturer if one has not been created. On the home page, there is the ability to search all products posted by any user. Users can also edit a product, manufacuter, or any user information.

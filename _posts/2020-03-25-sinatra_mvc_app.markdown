Recently, I created a project using Sintra, CSS, and html to create an app called ultra tracker. I created this following the theme from my CLI, which showed the toughest ultra marathons throughout the world. My goal coming into this project was to create a running tracker that could show your mileage, mood, and time. As I went on, I added different features to be able to see other accounts that have posted or being able to edit and delete past runs. Overall, this process had plenty of frustating times but slackoverflow defintely saved me when I was stuck. I am very happy with the final product and learned a lot more throughout this project!

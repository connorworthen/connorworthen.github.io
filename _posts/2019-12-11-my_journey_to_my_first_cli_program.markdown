Since I was young, I have always been interested in technology.  I started to get interested in coding when I took a computer science class in middle school. From there, my love with technology only grew as I got older. This grew to my goal to one day become a blockchain engineer which is why my project has to do with crypto currencies. Starting with my journey at Flatiron, I knew how to code at a basic level, but did not any ruby. From the start of the course to now, I have learned so much. This project was quite tough for me. I started coding and had created the basic skeleton of my program. I made a mistake and didn't save it, which lost all of my work from the past 2 days. From there, I started from scratch and created another skelton of my program. Slowly, I began changing almost all the code to make it perform better and create a better interface. I spent countless hours on zoom, trying figure out how to fix errors and learn from my mistakes. Finally, I was able to finish and have the project come together the way I liked. Though, this was a challenging project, it was also amazing. I learned a lot and was able to work through concepts I didn't understand before from the lessons.  I spent so much time on this project and I am very happy with how it turned out.

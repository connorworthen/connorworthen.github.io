When I was in middle school, I took an after school coding class. Little did I know that later on I would want to pursue software engineering as a career. During middle school I thought it was interseting but as time went on sports became the priority. After graduating high school, I went on to junior college not really knowing what I wanted to spend my whole life doing. About a year ago, I started dabbiling with coding again, mainly buidling fun programs in python. As I started getting more and more interested in tech, I decided to start looking for programs that could quickly teach me the skills I wanted to learn. When I strubmled upon Flatiron thats when I knew that this would be the program to help me start my career in software engineering.
